/*
Filename: ComplexCode.js

This JavaScript file contains a complex implementation of a music playlist generator. It generates random playlists based on user preferences and includes features such as shuffling, filtering, and recommendations.

The code is highly elaborate and includes various advanced JavaScript concepts such as classes, inheritance, asynchronous programming, and more.

Note: This code is just a simplified demonstration and may not fully reflect a production-ready playlist generator.
